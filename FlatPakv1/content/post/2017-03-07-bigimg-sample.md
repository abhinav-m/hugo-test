### For developers

**Run the same app on all the main Linux distributions**

Create one app bundle and distribute it to the entire Linux desktop market.
</br>
**Consistent environment for development, testing and deployment**
</br>
Develop and test your application in an environment that's identical to the one users have.
</br>
 **Easy-to-use, fully-documented build tools**
 </br>
Flatpak's build tools are simple and easy to use, and come with a full set of documentation.
</br>
**Maintained collections of essential dependencies**
</br>
Runtimes provide stable sets of dependencies that can be used by applications.
</br>
**Pick and choose application dependencies**
</br>
Dependencies that aren't in a runtime can be bundled as part of an application. Versions of the dependencies that are used can be fixed and patched.
</br>
**Future-proof builds**
</br>
Runtimes are forward compatible, irrespective of distribution changes. Flatpak applications run on new Linux distribution versions as they are released.
